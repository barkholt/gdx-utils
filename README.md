## gdx-utils
An updated fork of dermetfan's famed library.

BitBucket is killing off their Mercurial repositories, including gdx-utils, within the next year, so a backup is needed.
Also, libgdx-utils was stuck on version 1.9.6 of libGDX, and now we can update to 1.9.10, plus a Gradle update.

Legacy tends to prevent you from writing the best code possible. Being compatible with previous versions is therefore of low priority.
...lol.
