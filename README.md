## gdx-utils
An updated fork of dermetfan's famed library.

BitBucket has deleted their Mercurial repositories, including gdx-utils, so a backup is needed.
Also, libgdx-utils was stuck on version 1.9.6 of libGDX, and now we can update to 1.9.10, plus a Gradle update.

- Build Status: just check [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/#tommyettinger/gdx-utils); tell it to build any release or commit you want.

  - The wiki is down permanently; blame BitBucket and Atlassian.
- [~~Homepage~~](http://dermetfan.net/libgdx-utils.php)
  - The homepage is also down; dermetfan is doing something different.

# Philosophy #

~~Legacy tends to prevent you from writing the best code possible. Being compatible with previous versions is therefore
of low priority.~~ ...lol, that's a really awful philosophy. Working code is better than what was at one point the "best
code possible." If you're using this library, be aware:  you are using legacy code, and people have been using this code
for a long time now.
